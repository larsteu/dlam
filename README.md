# Predicting National Team Football Match Outcomes

[![PENGWIN2024TASK1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deep%20Learning%3A%20Architectures%20%26%20Methods-FOOTBALL%20EM%20PREDICTIONS-blue)](https://github.com/larsteu/dlam)

This repository contains the code for our Deep Learning: Architectures \& Methods project (course by TU Darmstadt). This project aims to predict the outcomes of national team football matches using a novel deep learning approach.
Our final evaluation is on the European Championship 2024 matches.

## Motivation
- Existing work on football match prediction focuses on statistical models [1-5] and league games [1,2].
- **Gap:** Deep learning-based prediction for national team games
- Challenges:
  - Sparse data for national team matches
  - Players from different leagues with varying competitive levels
- Proposed solutions:
  1. Input: Per-player average match statistics from the past year in their national leagues
  2. League-dependent weighting of player statistics
  3. Two-step training process to leverage more data:
     - Step 1: Train on league data
     - Step 2: Fine-tune on national matches

## Model Architecture

Our model consists of two main components:

1. Team Embedder: Processes average player performance to create team embeddings
2. Match Classifier: Takes two team embeddings as input and predicts the match result

### Training Step 1: League Data

### Training Step 2: National Team Data

## Results

- Evaluated on Euro 2024 (51 matches)
- Achieved approximately 59% accuracy
- Slightly outperformed betting odds
- **But:** Needs more evaluation: Euro 2024 only has 51 games.
